      <div class="landing__container">
        <h2> 4. NLP :</h2>
        <p>As the NLP technology evolves over years, computers will be extending their present capabilities from processing to understanding human language in quite a holistic way.</p>
        <p>Until now, NLP is restricted to infer only a limited range of human emotions including the feelings of anger or joy. Eventually, NLP will be programmed in such a way that it understands more complex elements of human emotions such as sarcasm, humor, irony, cynicism, and satire.</p>
